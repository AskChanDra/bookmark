# REST

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services.

```bash
GET     =>  READ        : Read or Retrieve a Resource
POST    =>  CREATE      : Create a new Resource
PUT     =>  UPDATE      : Update a Resource
DELETE  =>  DELETE      : Delete a Resource
Head    =>  CHECK       : Check if a Resource exists ?
OPTIONS =>  SUPPORT     : Retrieve all the verbs supported by a Resource

```
